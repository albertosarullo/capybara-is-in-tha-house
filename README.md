## History

Sometimes I use the wifi network of my friend. He live in the upper floor. His animal is Capybara.

Many times I have wondered if he was in the house, with the aim of testing its wireless connection.

In Italy there is a christian fm radio called 'radio maria'. My friend nicely hates this radio, beacause is the only radio that you hear everywhere, (expecially if you search another radio).

So, i created a trash physical gadget that transmit music (overwriting anything on the same fm frequency) when detect that my friend is in the house.
